Caddy is a web server that is written in Go. It is designed to be easy to use and configure, and it offers a number of features that make it a good choice for web hosting. Some of these features include:

Automatic HTTPS: Caddy automatically obtains and renews TLS certificates for your sites, and it even staples OCSP responses. This means that you don't have to worry about managing your own TLS certificates, and you can be confident that your sites are always secure.
Reverse proxying: Caddy can be used as a reverse proxy, which allows you to easily expose multiple services behind a single domain name. This is useful for hosting multiple websites, or for providing access to internal services from the internet.
Static file serving: Caddy can be used as a static file server, which means that it can be used to serve files like images, CSS, and JavaScript. This is useful for websites that don't need a lot of dynamic content.
Kubernetes ingress: Caddy can be used as an ingress controller for Kubernetes. This means that you can use Caddy to expose your Kubernetes services to the internet.
Caddy is a powerful and versatile web server that can be used for a variety of tasks. It is easy to use and configure, and it offers a number of features that make it a good choice for web hosting.
